The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you forget to include spaces around the + or - operators, it might not work as expected. 
For example, the following code will not work as intended:

```css
div{width:calc(100%-10px);}
```

The correct syntax is:

```css
div{width:calc(100% - 10px);}
```
